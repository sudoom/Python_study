    "Please read the Hangman Introduction before starting this problem. \n",
    "We'll start by writing 3 simple functions that will help us easily code the Hangman problem. \n",

This function returns a boolean - `True` if `secretWord` has been guessed (ie, all the letters of `secretWord` are in `lettersGuessed`) and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",

    "  3. `mistakesMade`: The number of incorrect guesses made so far.\n",
    "  4. `availableLetters`: The letters that may still be guessed. Every time a player guesses a letter, the guessed letter must be removed from `availableLetters` (and if they guess a letter that is not in `availableLetters`, you should print a message telling them they've already guessed that - so try again!).\n",
